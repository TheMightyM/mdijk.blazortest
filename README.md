# mdijk.blazortest
A test repository for a Blazor WebAssembly project.

# Usage
This application has no purpose other then showing some Blazor Concepts. Open in visual studio and run it!

# Database
All data is uses is imported from a public F1 api, see http://ergast.com/mrd
Use the IMPORTER project to import most of it. For some larger datasets, it uses several downloaded files.
All paths are harcoded, in case someone actually wants to use this, that part needs to be changed

# Styling
I have a personal licence for the theme used in this application, but I do not feel comfortable uploading those files to a public repo. So, you will have no styling when running this app. Sorry.

# Coding and stuff
Everything in this project is a mix of Dutch and English. All real code (functions, methods, variables, stuff like that) should be in English, but some comments will be in Dutch. Not really worthwhile comments. Also, I try my best with English, but I am dyslectic so there might be some wierd texts in here on occasion.

# Machine Learning
There is a terrible attempt at trying to use ML.NET to predict the laptimes of drivers for a race. Does not produce any meaningful data. The only thing I learned from it: I most certainly do not have the required data and the required skills to do this.
